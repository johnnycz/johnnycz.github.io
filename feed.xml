        <title>There must be a better software</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The title of this article is a lie. It’s not always true that there “must” be better software. There’s always a lot of compromise in software. I don’t just mean the classial triangle of time - quality - number of features. Software reflects different ideas by many people involved in its design. If software was a cake, there would often be fruit, cream, cucumbers and meat in it. Because somebody wasn’t always on board with the idea of making a cake, so we threw some meat in. Software is a compromise, and a compromise means that there is no winner who takes it all, and so better quality is not always what is actually desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the title of this post is a lie, but it suggests what I would like to write about on this blog: software and its quality. Very often quality of software suffers and it’s not because of admitted compromises, but because writing good quality software is a skill that one person can probably never fully master. It takes a lot of time; it requires an open mind; it requires changing your views very frequently; it requires rejecting ideas that seemed great just a few moments ago. It is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of techniques and tools to write better software, but then there’s also a certain mindset that helps thinking about software, making better decisions about software and therefore actually writing better software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides this I would also like to write about my personal experiences related to writing software.&lt;/p&gt;
